This was a team project for school; collaborated with two other classmates for the project. Assignment was for a web page with:
- menus
- tables
- images
- image maps
- rollover button or image
- links and animation in Canvas

My work on the project included css styling, linear gradients in the header display, menu, images with shadows and transition features, and tables.
